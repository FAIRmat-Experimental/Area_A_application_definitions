There is a nice package called [specio](https://specio.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sec_user.html) to read sp binary files from perkin ellmer.

In the folder `perkin_ellmer_example_files` are a bunch of exported files from the UV WinLab to serve as an example to construct an ELN entry for UV_VIS devices from perkin ellmer.
